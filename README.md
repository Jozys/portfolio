### My Website

In this repository you will find the source code of my website (which is available at <a href="https://joshua.slaar.de" >https://joshua.slaar.de</a>)
The Website is made with <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/"> create-react-app </a> and TypeScript. I also used Material UI v4 for the theming part.

#### Why a website?

I personally wanted to develop this website for my personal representation.

##### Current availibity

Currently as of JUNE 2023 the website is not avaible, because I have not finished developing.
